      <h2>Where I have appointments</h2>
      <ul>
       	<li>My office is in Liberty Lake, where parking is free and the building handicapped accessible. You are welcome to visit me at my office, by appointment.</li>
       	<li>I also make "house calls." Our meeting can be at your home or that of a family member, a hospital or the place where you are receiving care. I do not charge for travel time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>When I am available</h2>
      <ul>
       	<li>I am available on the day and time that works for your family, including evenings and weekends, by appointment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How I charge for services</h2>
      <ul>
       	<li>I charge when there is some legal service I can provide for you. Once we know what that is, I will quote, in most cases a flat fee for my work so we both know what to expect. All flat fees include reasonable contact by telephone, email, mail or in-person meetings until we have met your need.</li>
       	<li>I will charge you for court or other fees like deed recording on a pass-through basis, but not for mundane things like copies or postage.</li>
       	<li>My fees are reasonable and I work hard to keep costs low. I accept credit cards and payment plans. If the fee is an issue, please discuss it with me.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>If I cannot do it, I will help you find someone who can.</h2>
      <ul>
       	<li>I am not the kind of attorney you see in the courtroom on television. I confine my practice to planning, counseling and document preparation. If your matter is one that may end up in court, or for which I do not have the skills you need, I will refer you to another trusted attorney.</li>
       	<li>I have a wide network of professionals who provide services to elders and their families and I routinely make referrals within my network. Please ask if you are looking for a certain type of in-home care or care facility, a financial advisor, a realtor or any other type of service. Serving elders is a team effort.</li>
